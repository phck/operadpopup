        <div class="title">The relative 2-operad of 2-associahedra in symplectic geometry</div>
        <div class="abstract">
            <p>The Fukaya A<sub>∞</sub>-category Fuk(M) is a rich invariant of a symplectic manifold M, and its manipulation and computation is a core focus of current symplectic geometry. Building on work of Wehrheim and Woodward, I have proposed that the correct way to encode the functoriality properties of Fuk is by defining an “(A<sub>∞</sub>,2)-category” called Symp, in which the objects are symplectic manifolds and hom(M,N) is defined to be Fuk(M<sup>−</sup> × N). Underlying the new notion of an (A<sub>∞</sub>,2)-category is a family of abstract polytopes called 2-associahedra, which form a “relative 2-operad” (another new notion, which is related to Batanin’s theory of higher operads). I will describe all of these constructions from scratch, without assuming any knowledge of symplectic geometry. This talk is based partly on joint work with Shachar Carmeli, and I will mention related joint work with Alexei Oblomkov.</p>

        <div class="title">Goodwillie calculus and operads</div>
        <div class="abstract">
            <p>The goal of this talk is to survey the role of operads in Goodwillie’s calculus of functors. A key observation is that the derivatives of the identity functor, on a suitable pointed ∞-category <i>C</i>, admit an operad structure which in the case of pointed spaces recovers a spectral version of the Lie operad. I will give a couple different ways to construct the operad structure in general, and then focus on the case where <i>C</i> is itself the ∞-category of algebras over some (stable, non-unital) operad <i>P</i>. In that case, the derivatives of the identity functor on <i>C</i> recover, in some form, the operad <i>P</i>.</p>

        <div class="title">Sweedler duals for monads</div>
        <div class="abstract">
            <p>While the linear dual of any coalgebra is an algebra, the converse is not true; however, there is an adjoint to the coalgebra-to-algebra functor, given by the so-called Sweedler dual.</p>

            <p>There is a notion of “linear dual” for an endofunctor of Set, given by homming into the identity functor for the Day convolution structure. Again, this sends comonads to monads, but not vice versa; but again, there is an adjoint. This “Sweedler dual” comonad of a monad was introduced by Katsumata, Rivas and Uustalu in 2019.</p>

            <p>The purpose of this talk is to give an explicit construction of the Sweedler dual comonad of any monad on Set. The category of coalgebras for the Sweedler dual turns out to be a presheaf category, whose indexing category can be described explicitly in terms of a kind of computational dynamics of the monad. If time permits, we also describe the source-etale topological category which classifies the topological Sweedler dual comonad of a monad on Set; in particular, this recovers all kinds of etale topological groupoids of interest in the study of combinatorial C<sup>*</sup>-algebras.</p>
